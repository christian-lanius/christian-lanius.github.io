Hello!
I Christian, a PhD student at the [IDS at Aachen University](https://www.ids.rwth-aachen.de).

My research interests include low power digital circuit design, especially with a focus on **standard-cell based Compute-in-Memory**. 

I received my B. Sc. in electrical engineering from RWTH Aachen University in 2016 and, as part of a double degree program, M.Sc. from both Keio University and RWTH Aachen in 2019. In Aachen, my specialization lies in micro-and nanoelectronics, working at, and being supervised at [ICE@RWTH](https://www.ice.rwth-aachen.de) . At Keio University I was part of the [AOKI media lab](https://aoki-medialab.jp/home-en/).
