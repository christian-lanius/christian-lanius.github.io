## Projects

In the following, I will share some projects that I have been working on as part of my PhD.

### Opensource EDA Flow
The classes from our chair cover digital circuit design, from computer arithmetics to filter design. Students learn how adders, multipliers, rate conversion and other filters are implemented. To bridge the gap from purely theoretical to actual applying this, we want students to implement circuits in Verilog themselves. 

Inspired by [Eda Playground](https://edaplayground.com/), we developed a website where students choose an exercise, upload their verilog and we run a testbench in the background (using iverilog), perform synthesis (using yosys and open-source standard-cells), and perform power and timing analysis (using OpenSTA).
